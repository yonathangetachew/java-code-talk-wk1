The given code defines a Java class named Factorial, which contains two methods: factorial and main. 
The factorial method takes an integer n as input and calculates the factorial of the number. 
Factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. 

The method initializes a variable result to 1 and then uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to n. 
During each iteration, the value of i is multiplied with the current value of result, updating result accordingly. Once the loop completes, the method returns the calculated result.

The main method serves as the entry point for the program. Within main, an integer variable number is declared and assigned the value 5. 
The factorial method is called with number as an argument, and the returned result is stored in the variable result. 

Finally, the program prints the output using System.out.println, displaying the factorial of the input number.

When executed with number = 5, the factorial method calculates the factorial as 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, which equals 120. Hence, the output of the program will be:
Factorial of 5 is: 120

The factorial method can be used to find the factorial of any non-negative integer passed as an argument to the method, making it a versatile utility for factorial calculations in Java programs.
